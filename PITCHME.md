# Switch to Linux from Windows

---

## What is Linux ?
Just like Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Mac OS X, Linux is an operating system. An operating system is software that manages all of the hardware resources associated with your desktop or laptop. To put it simply – the operating system manages the communication between your software and your hardware. Without the operating system (often referred to as the “OS”), the software wouldn’t function.

+++

## Why use Linux ?
Linux is a free and open source platform which many operating systems are built upon. If you’re looking to move from Windows to an alternative, here are eight compelling reasons why you should leave Microsoft for a more free and open source operating system.

+++

### 1. Free operating systems for life

All Linux-based operating systems (for the most part) are completely free. You won’t find yourself driving to a Best Buy to buy your copy of Fedora Linux. All that is required is a USB flash drive, an Internet connection and the know-how to get it installed.

+++

### 2. Free programs

More free stuff. Sounds good, right? If you were to install Ubuntu Linux on your laptop, you’d have access to tons of software totally free of charge. You see, Ubuntu operates on the notion that software should be free. Sure, if you look hard enough, you can probably find some programs that cost money, but paid software is largely a minority on the Linux platform.

+++

### 3. Better security

One of Linux’s huge strengths is how seriously security is taken. When you install software it is impossible for you to do so without knowingly entering your password.

Each package go through each and every package and verify that it isn’t malicious and even sign them. This removes the ability for malicious software to install itself (like on Windows).

+++

### 4. It’ll run on anything, including aging hardware

You’d be hard-pressed to find a copy of Microsoft’s latest operating system that can run on something as little as 128 megabytes of RAM. As for Linux, this is totally possible. If you have an aging computer that isn’t compatible with Windows 10, don’t worry! There are Linux projects out there that specifically focus on old hardware.

+++

### 5. No walled gardens

When you use a Linux distribution as your main operating system, you’re not expected to have a Microsoft account, a copy of Office 365, Xbox Live, a Skype account and a One Drive account. You’re not forced to participate in an ecosystem that you may not agree with, and Linux isn’t filled to the brim with one company’s “vision.”  Instead, you get to choose your own. Who can argue with that?

+++

### 6. Your privacy is taken seriously

In Windows 10 your privacy is mostly disregarded. A lot of aspects to Windows 10 are less than privacy-friendly. When you use Microsoft’s new operating system, you are telling them that it is okay for them to collect data on you. They harvest information on your device’s location, your calendar data, emails and texts, contact info, and the list goes on.

+++

### 7. Open source

Most, if not all, Linux distributions are made in part by open source technologies. A vanilla installation of your favorite Linux-based operating system likely won’t contain any closed-code programs. This makes it easier to give away the operating system for free, but it also means that modification of the operating system is legally allowed. This means that if you want, you can freely modify your operating system until your heart is content.

+++

### 8. Customization

Have you ever wanted to change the icons or the way the folders look in Windows? What about the overall way the task bar looks? Maybe you just want to try out a new desktop entirely. On Microsoft’s operating system, this isn’t entirely possible. You’re stuck with the Windows 10 look, and there’s just no getting around that.

+++

#### And most importantly every nerd and geek (also Hacker) out there uses Linux.

## Why not to switch from Windows to Linux ?

Linux takes time and enthusiasm to get friend with. Commands, Commands and Commands is all that is going to be your best friend. If you don’t have that, I would suggest you not to switch entirely to Linux. If you want, you may install both.

+++

### 1. Microsoft Office

Productivity on any operating system is without doubt one of the most important things that can make or break a platform however, execution is the key – if done right, enterprise adaptation would be shortly underway.

Although there are tools like LibreOffice, Apache OpenOffice etc but Microsoft Office is the king of office productivity software, so if your work depends heavily on such softwares then linux may not be for you.

+++

### 2. Gaming

Linux is a third-tier gaming platform, with nearly no major studios releasing Linux versions of their games. Mac is second tier, so maybe you don’t care much about games, anyway.

You can still play the heavy games on linux using wine or stem but you will be missing the feel.

+++

### 3. Media Production

Forget ProTools, Garageband, Photoshop, Lightroom, Final Cut. If you do professional class media production, the “open source equivalents” fall short for professionals.

+++

### 4. Flaky driver support for some hardwares

Linux support is always a second tier priority, if any, for hardware providers. The open source community may or may not pick up the ball, and the resulting drivers will vary dramatically in quality. The media drivers are the worst of the bunch, with video drivers being a special circle of hell.

#### “Linux is simple and beautiful, but it takes a effort to understand it’s simplicity and beauty.”

So now it is your choice, what you want for your machine's operating system Windows, Linux or maybe something else completely.

For those of brave souls who are considering switching to Linux, here is my guide to make the transition a little less painful.

## How To Choose The Best Linux Distro For Your Needs ?

There are hundreds of Linux distributions, for people new to Linux however it is possibly tricky to know which Linux distro is best for them.

[Distrowatch.com](Distrowatch.com) gives a short description of each one as well as a table showing how easy they are to install, who they are for, level of expertise required and the desktop environment that they use.

+++

#### 1. Linux Mint

Linux Mint provides a modern take on what many people have become accustomed to over the years. If you have ever used Windows XP, VIsta or Windows 7 then you will appreciate that there is a panel at the bottom, a menu, a series of quick launch icons and a system tray.

It is easy to install, comes with all the applications you need for general home computing and provides straight forward computing for the masses.

+++

#### 2. Ubuntu

Ubuntu is a modern desktop operating system designed for the masses and is meant to be every bit as easy to use as Windows or OSX.

With full hardware integration and a complete set of applications most beginners see this as the first step onto the Linux ladder.

If you want to try something other than Windows and you are worried about Linux relying too hard on the command line try Ubuntu because you won't need the terminal window at all.

Easy to install and easy to use with great support.

+++

#### 3. Fedora (My Favorite)

Fedora is a community distribution based on Red Hat.

Designed to be cutting edge, Fedora always comes with up to date software and drivers and was one of the first distributions to introduce both Wayland and SystemD.

Straight forward to install and comes with a good range of software. Can be temperamental due to the fact that it is so cutting edge and not all packages are stable.
